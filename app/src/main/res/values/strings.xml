    <string name="desc2">"This is the activity where albums are shown. The idea is to have linkables images with the songs activity as a destination.
        \n For this application and to show how it would work, I have added a clickable ImageView for the first album and if the user clicks on it, he/she will be redirected to the songs activity. This has been done with an intent from an ImageView."</string>
    <string name="desc3">"This is the activity where all the info about the artist would be. For this activity, I'm only showing the structure, not the real info. It would include a picture and a little bio with some professional data".</string>
    <string name="desc4">"This activity would include all the songs for an album. In this case, I have only added three but it would have several more. For each song the user would find a play button and a stop one.
        \n I have implemented a playing method and a stopping method for the first song to show how it would work."</string>
